=== jQuery Lightbox For Native Galleries ===
Contributors: Viper007Bond
Tags: lightbox, jquery, gallery
Requires at least: 2.6
Tested up to: 3.4
Stable tag: trunk

Makes the native WordPress galleries use a lightbox script called ColorBox to display the fullsize images.

== Description ==

**DISCONTINUATION NOTICE:** Development on this plugin has ceased in favor of the carousel module in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/">Jetpack plugin</a>. I recommend you use that plugin instead -- it's much more full featured.

------------------------

Makes the native WordPress galleries use a lightbox script called [ColorBox](http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/) to display the fullsize images right there in the page. No modifications required.

You can also make single non-`[gallery]` images use the lightbox by giving their links a class of "lightbox", like so:

`<a href="..." class="lightbox"><img src="..." alt="..." /></a>`


== Installation ==

Log into the administration area of your blog and click on Plugins -> Add New in the menu. Search for the name of this plugin and then click install on the right side, and then again in the pop-up window.

* Update ColorBox to v1.3.6 (see [it's changelog](http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/core/README)).

= Version 3.1.2 =
* Remove IE PNG fixes as they require a full URL and it's not worth the trouble. Works well enough in IE8.

= Version 3.1.0 =
* Update ColorBox to v1.3.3.
* Include all five of the default ColorBox themes and add a settings page to pick between them.
* Change the lightbox maxwidth and maxheight to 95% as I think it looks better.

* Don't do anything inside of feeds (i.e. modify the thumbnail links).

= Version 3.0.1 =
* Fix spelling mistake on the ColorBox style ID.

* Switch the awesome [ColorBox](http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/). It looks pretty and does large image resizing. Yay!

= Version 2.0.0 =
* Switched lightbox scripts as I was unhappy with the previous one.

= Version 1.1.0 =
* Update jquery_lightbox package. It now supports resizing images that are too large as well as not disabling IE6 support.

* Initial release.
